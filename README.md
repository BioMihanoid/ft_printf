_This is a **21 School/Ecole 42** Project_

# Ft_printf
Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough

## Description
The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. I will recode printf().

## Project goals

I will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments.

## How to compile/to run

You open console in Linux/MacOS and enter the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/BioMihanoid/ft_printf
cd ft_printf
make
```

After compilation, you will be able to use this function in your project and it can partially replace your printf for you.
